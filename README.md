# The Painter App
A Painter App (like the one on Windows) using Turtle library in Python. It involves a fixed palette of various colors, line thickness control buttons, eraser, a button to clear the whole page, and a button to divide the page vertically into two symmetric parts, such that what is drawn on one part appears reflected on the other.
